        "description": "The lack of graphics and the sheer amount of possibilities may overwhelm a new player, but this game is definitely worth playing. Adventurer mode lets you play as a single dwarf in a generated world to do whatever you desire.\r\nIn fortress mode you arrive with a small band of 7 dwarfs and some inventory to start a new life. Dig into the Earth, trade with caravans, fight goblins and accidentally murder all your dwarves. Losing is fun.",

        "description": "Many of us find the direction that the video game industry is moving in disturbing: the rampant commercialization of gaming has led us to the world of the yearly remaster and the weekly DLC. Dwarf Fortress is a refreshing step away from that world. The fact that two guys hunkered down in a basement for 14 years could make a a game that surpasses anything ever made commercially whilst still technically being in beta is extraordinary. Yes, there isn't so much a learning curve as a learning cliff; yes, the game is so unforgiving that the fanbase has adopted the mantra \"Losing is Fun\"; yes, the game's \"graphics\" look like a monitor malfunction; but in the end, you will have experienced a game like no other.",
